/*
Create an object that acts a water bottle.

It will need a volume property to store how full or empty the bottle is. 

Volume will be 100 when bottle is full and 0 when empty. 

Give your water bottle methods for 
  - filling it up
  - pouring 10 units of water into it
    Note: You cannot exceed the bottle capacity.
  - drinking 10 units from it
    Note: You cannot drink more than its actual contents.
  - and telling if the bottle is full
  - and telling if the bottle is empty

We made a start on this here by giving you the skeleton of our object.

You have to implement the missing features according to the specification.
*/

// Here is your starting point:
let bottle = {
  volume: 0,
  fillUp: function () {
    // calling this function should completely fill your bottle (volume = 100);
    return (this.volume = 100);
  },
  pour: function () {
    // calling this function should increase your bottle volume by 10 units;
    return (this.volume += 10);
  },
  drink: function () {
    // calling this function should decrease your bottle volume by 10 units;
    return (this.volume -= 10);
  },
  isFull: function () {
    // this function should return true if your bottle is full;
    if (this.volume === 100) {
      return true;
    }
  },
  isEmpty: function () {
    // this function should return true if your bottle is empty;
    if (this.volume === 0) {
      return true;
    }
  },
};

/*
TIP:
  Remember that for changing properties on the current object inside one of its
  methods you can refer to it by its variable name: `bottle` or by using the keyword `this`.
*/

/*
Extra question:
  Why do you think it is preferred to use `this` inside the object rather than its variable name, in our case `bottle`?
  Leave your answer below:

Once you have completed your object run the following
