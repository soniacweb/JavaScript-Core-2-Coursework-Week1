/*
As you you can have an Array of Objects, you can also store Arrays in Objects.

In this exercise, you'll practice:
 - How to loop through the properties (keys) of an Object and read its values.
 - How to access an Array stored inside an Object.
 - How to access a specific property of an array and set it.

You're going shopping, and you need a shopping list. You've already created your weekly meal plan
that contains the missing ingredients for your menus. It is stored in the "weeklyMealPlan" object.
Complete the exercises below.
